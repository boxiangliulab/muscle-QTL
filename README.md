# muscle-QTL

Lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise, are pivotal in managing obesity and type-2 diabetes (T2D). Although interactions between genetic regulation and lifestyle have been studied in rats and baboons, they are rarely characterized in humans because of challenges in recruitment and compliance. We studied 54 Asian participants with obesity before and after a 16-week diet and exercise intervention, collecting 252 clinical traits, lipidomes, and skeletal muscle transcriptomics. Weight loss was observed in 98% of participants, with 84% showing increased insulin sensitivity. Significant changes were observed in 505 genes in muscle after intervention, particularly mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity. We identified hundreds of eQTLs and sQTLs both under pre-intervention and post-intervention, including those interacting with diet and exercise intervention (interaction QTLs), with approximately 4.2% and 7.3% showing East-Asian specificity. Notably, ANK1 gene expression decreased post-intervention, showing gene-environment interaction, and with only pre-intervention sQTLs colocalizing with T2D GWAS signals. We identified putative risk genes by colocalizing e/sQTLs with GWAS. This study highlights the impact of lifestyle on genetic regulation and enhance our understanding of how gene-environment (GxE) interactions contribute to the interpretation of metabolic GWAS signals.
